# RSA Encryption
This program is an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm. In order to do the
computation required for this algorithm weâ€™ll be using the GMP library. We will be creating,
using various theoretical functions, to compute a private and public key in order to encrypt
and decrypt files.\
    This program will be split into three separate: encrypt, decrypt, keygen. The encryptor will
take in a file to encrypt, use the public-key, and output the encrypted file. The decryptor will
intake a file to decrypt, use the private-key, and output the decrypted file. The keygen in ques-
tion will take a specified amount of bits, a file for the private key, a file for the public key, and a
random seed for the state. The keygen will then run our theoretic functions in order to generate
our primes, coprimes, inverses, and totients to generate our public and private keys.

## Building
`make`          Equivelent to `make all`.\
`make all`      Makes keygen, encrypt, and decrypt.\
`make keygen`   Makes keygen program.\
`make encrypt`  Makes encrypt program.\
`make decrypt`  Makes decrypt program.\
`make clean`    Cleans all .o files and programs.\
`make format`   Clang formats all .[ch] files.\
`make debug`    Makes all programs with debug flags.

## Running
`./encrypt -[vh] -[i infile] -[o outfile] -[n pbfile]`\
`./decrypt -[vh] -[i infile] -[o outfile] -[d pvfile]`\
`./keygen -[vh] -[b bits] -[s seed] -[c confidence] -[n pbfile] -[d pvfile]`

## Arguments List
```
-h  Displays help message for respective program.
-v  Displays statistics and verbose messages for the respective program.
-i  Infile to decrypt / encrypt.
-o  Outfile to decrypt / encrypt.
-n  File to read / write the public key.
-d  File to read / write the private key.
